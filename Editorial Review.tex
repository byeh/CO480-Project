\subsection*{Fact Checking}
% If all of the facts check out then write something like
The facts are correct and no important omissions were noted. Or ...
% If there are notes place them in a list like this.
% Use + to count lines from the top of a page and -- to count lines from the bottom
\begin{itemize}
\item Typographical error. Page 7, Line +11. ``1673'' should be ``1637''
\item Error. Page 7, Line --5. Newton was not the first to make use of a chord to suggest a means of defining a tangent. Barrow did this in 1670 in {\em Lectiones Geometricae}.
\item Dispute. Page 9, Line +3. You quote Napoleon ``Women are nothing but machines for producing children.'' and assert that such an attitude dominated Europe at the time. However, both Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria are clearly counterexamples.
\item Omission. Page 11, Line --12. In describing the growth of science in Europe in the 1400's, you omit the contributions of Moorish scholars in Cordoba who provide training and texts to visiting Europeans.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Editing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Typographical error. Page 7, Line +11. ``nad'' should be ``and''
\item Phrasing. Page 7, Line --5. The sentence ``Blah blah blah'' is much too long. You could break it up as ``Blah. Blah. Blah.'', or shorten it to ``Blah. Less blah.''
\item Confused. Page 9, Line +3. You say ``Blah.''. Were you intending to say ``Halb.''?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mathematics}

The mathematics is/is not targeted at a suitable audience.

\begin{itemize}
\item Typographical error. Page +7, Line +11. $f(x,y)$ should be $f(y,x)$.
\item Phrasing. Page 7, Line --5. Use induction and make your argument more formal.
\item Error. Page 9, Line +3. Your argument assumes that the series converges but here is a proof that it does not.
\item Omission. Page 2, Line +2. Your first line is ``Let $m > 0$.'' The next line is ``It is easy to see that $e = mc^2$.'' More detail would be useful.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Plagiarism}

There is no/is evidence of plagiarism.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
\item Uncited extract. Page +7, Line +11. This uncited paragraph comes entirely from the wikipedia entry on Napoleon I at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_I}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{References}

The references are/are not correct and useful.

\begin{itemize}
\item The book ``Everything You Wanted To Know About Hyperbolas'' by I M Crazy does not exist.
\item The book ``Everything You Wanted To Know About Hyperbolas'' exists but is unrelated to the project.
\item I was unable to verify the contents of {\em Yi Gu Yan Duan} because I do not read ancient Chinese.
\end{itemize}
