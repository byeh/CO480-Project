Overall, this report needs significant work in both content and quality of writing. While the project describes in sufficient detail the life of Isaac Newton prior to his mental breakdown in 1693, this leaves a major gap in the history of the person. Additionally, there is no clear place section that identifies the historical backdrop to Newton's work. While an attempt is made to describe the need for calculus beginning from Ancient Greece, this section is simply a restatement of the course lectures. Furthermore, each individual section of this history attempt is not in-depth enough to constitute a description of the place and background of Newton's work. With respect to the mathematics, this paper simply presents simple concepts (e.g. Binomial Theorem) that have been presented numerous times in core mathematics classes. These concepts are not treated in a new way - they are simply direct copies of existing works. While there is some promise when the report deals with applications of calculus, no section is developed thoroughly enough to present any new mathematical knowledge to the reader.\\

In terms of quality of writing, the report leaves much to be desired. The report has numerous grammatical errors (inconsistent capitalization, incorrect punctuation, etc.) as well as many typographical errors. Many sections do not seem to add value to the report and are difficult to follow. A more detailed outLine may help the authors reconstruct the report in a way that will flow better to present an easier to follow report. While the report has a number of valuable sources, there are many passages which are directly quoted or taken from sources with no citation provided. Finally, the report has large portions of whitespace, and even then only uses 16 of the possible 20 pages, leaving a large amount of room to provide additional details and expand on the topics presented.

\subsection*{Fact Checking}
% If all of the facts check out then write something like
% If there are notes place them in a list like this.
% Use + to count lines from the top of a page and -- to count lines from the bottom
Most fact are correct, and there are few major omissions. The following are omissions that if included, would enhance the report.
\begin{itemize}
\item Omission, Page 1, +4: While the date of Newton's birth is accurate according to some records, the report does not discuss the change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar which has caused some ambiguity as to the exact date of birth. Alternate date is January 4, 1643

\item Omission, Page 3, +10: While Newton's Principia was not printed until 1687 as stated, it was actually presented to the Royal Society and accepted for publication early in 1686 and a series of discussions and politicking delayed its publication. A discussion of these reasons would have enhanced the report. \url{http://users.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/pages/13-NDFE/newton/05-newton-timeline-m.htm}
\item Dispute, Page 4, --10: The claim that Elements had more editions that the Bible was not substantiated.
\item Omission, Page 13, Section 3.1.4: This section is missing significant depth on the dispute between Leibniz and Newton regarding the invention of the calculus. Specifically, the authors present a case that lays the root of the conflict squarely at the feet of Leibniz. However, this was not the case. A number of other actors were involved with the dispute, and this passage does a disservice to the reader in not providing the full context of the dispute. \url{http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sastry/hs323/calculus.pdf}

\subsection*{Editing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rewriting these parts to improve clarity and readability
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Page 2, Line +12, 13: Replace ``As a sizar, even though ..." with ``Though his family was quite wealthy, Newton had to work as a sizar, like a servant, for his classmates"
		\item Page 3, Line +13,14,15: The sentence ``During his collegiate years ..." is a run on sentence. Consider splitting after ``advanced mathematics of the day"
		\item Page 2, Line -5,-4,-3,-2: The sentence ``Although there were ..." is a run=on sentence. Consider splitting after ``advanced mathematics of the day".
		\item Page 5, Line +12,13: The sentence ``Making philosophies as ..."  does not make sense on its own. Consider combining the sentence prior to it. ``In contrast to Plato's methodologial approach to biology by performing experiments and observations, Aristotle approached physics from a more philosophical manner"
		\item Page 5, Line +15: Consider rewriting ``these philosophies were taken as the truth by people" as ``people took these philosophies as the truth for"
		\item Page 5, Line +15: Change ``range from" to "span"
		\item Page 5, Line+16: Insert Oxford comma to change ``logic and biology" to `logic, and biology"
		\item Page 5, Line -18: The sentence "For example, the root ..." does not make sense.
		\item Page 5, Line -14: The sentence ``... motion on an object ... acting upon it" should read ``another object acting upon a given object causes motion on the other object"
		\item Page 5, Line +1: The sentence ``Various views ..." is a run-on sentence. Consider splitting at ``Ptolmey"
		\item Page 6, Line +1,+2,+3: Rewrite the sentence "Various views..." as "For over a thousand years, various views existed about the arrangement of the Earth, sun, planets and stars"
		\item Page 6, Section 2.1.2: Change the title heading from ``Islamic Golden Age" to something such as ``The Awakening of Europe" or include additional information about Islamic scholars as the section does not currently focus on Islamic scholars.
		\item Page 6, Line -1: The ending of the sentence ``... being seemingly true`` is awkward.
		\item Page 8, Line +4, +5: The sentence ``Even in relatively low speed... launching off an already moving object is to be left behind" is wordy and confusing. 
		\item Page 8, Line +21: It's not clear which book is being referred to.
		\item Page 9, Line +1,+2,+3: This sentence does not make sense. 
		\item Page 11, Line +2, +3: ``The discovery of tangents were most important ... accelerations, for example." Try to reword this to be more direct.
		\item Page 13, +5,+6: It is not clear why being useful in understanding partial derivatives makes Leibniz notation the standard notation for calculus.
		\item Page 14, Line -2: It is not clear how having different notation resulted in the accreditation that they both invented calculus independently.
		\item Page 15, Line +1: This sentence is incomplete since it does not express a full thought.
		\item Page 15, Line -2,-3,-4:``Primarily dealing with ... which creates chemical compounds" is a sentence fragment
		\item Page 16, Line +10: The paragraph jumps abruptly from ``securities" to ``bonds".

\subsection*{Mathematics}

The mathematics is/is not targeted at a suitable audience.

\begin{itemize}
\item Typographical error. Page +7, Line +11. $f(x,y)$ should be $f(y,x)$.
\item Phrasing. Page 7, Line --5. Use induction and make your argument more formal.
\item Error. Page 9, Line +3. Your argument assumes that the series converges but here is a proof that it does not.
\item Omission. Page 2, Line +2. Your first line is ``Let $m > 0$.'' The next line is ``It is easy to see that $e = mc^2$.'' More detail would be useful.
